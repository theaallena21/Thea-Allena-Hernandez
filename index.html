            <h2>History</h2>
   
            <P>Magandang Buhay. The Philippines, known as the Republic of the Philippines is in Southeast Asia. In 1521, the country was claimed in the name of Spain by a Portuguese explorer sailing for Spain, Ferdinand Magellan. The Philippines is named after King Philip II of Spain and Manila was set up as the capital of the country in 1571. The country was ruled by Spain for 300 years. It lasted through 1898 with Spain’s defeat in the Spanish-American war. During those time, the Spanish language was declared the official language of the Philippines. Therefore, often Tagalog words are gained from Spanish. So, if you know some Spanish words you are most likely to find the language easy to learn and you’ll notice the similarity of both languages. </P>
            
            <P> Way back 1800s, a man named Jose Rizal became the National Hero of the Philippines as he stood up for Filipino people against the Spanish through writing. To portray the abuse of Spanish rule, he wrote two important novels. He was executed by the Spanish colonial government on 30 December 1896. </P>
            
            <P>Today, Filipinos consider the Independence of the Philippines as one of the biggest milestones in Philippine History. It is often a day when they forget all our cultural differences and unite as true Filipinos. In a nation’s history, great events whether in peace or war live in our memories regardless of time. We look back at a century of the colonization tradition to seek the golden thread that explains why it seems to grow in importance with each passing year. Filipinos nationwide, commemorate the Independence of the Philippines on the 12th of July annually after President Diosdado Macapagal changed the date from July 4, the day when a treaty was made declaring the freedom of the Philippines from the United States. Independence Day was decided to remember those who made the ultimate sacrifice in defense of our nation. We use this day to not only remember the soldiers from the war against colonizers but also to remember the families of soldiers who did return. For fully half the people who were killed in the war, nothing was left but their names. We must remember and acknowledge the sacrifice and dedication of those who contributed so much to shaping the identity of this proud nation. As they say, “freedom only survives as long as people are willing to defend it.” A day to appreciate Filipino heritage, culture and tradition.  </P>
            
            <h2>About</h2>
            
            <P>The Philippines' national flower which is the sampaguita symbolizing purity, simplicity, humility and strength. The carabao, national animal that symbolizes power, efficiency, perseverance and most of all hard work as it complements the people in our country as such. President Fidel Ramos declared the Philippine Eagle as the national bird of the Philippines on 4th July 1995 under Proclamation No. 615, series of 1995. The colours of the Philippine flag, red indicating bravery and courage of those who fought for the country and patriotism. White triangle symbolizing equality and freedom as on the 12th of June, we commemorate the declaration of Philippine Independence from Spain in 1898. The colour blue signifying justice and sacrifice. Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao are the country’s main island groups. The country’s capital, Manila, is located in Luzon. Visayas’ main islands are Cebu, Bohol, Leyte, Masbate, Negros, Panay and Samar. Mindanao is the second largest island (after Luzon) in the Philippines. It is the only area in the Philippines with a significant Muslim presence. From our buzzing capital Manila to the peaceful Ifugao rice terraces, our 8 dialects from Tagalog to Waray, the different influences you see in our culture from Chinese to Spanish. Our 7,641 islands and 111,046,913 people that make up what we call our home, The Philippines.  We are one. </P>
