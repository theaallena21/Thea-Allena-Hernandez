        <b>Early Life</b>
            
            <P>A hero, José Protasio Rizal Mercado Y Alonso Realonda aka Jose Rizal, was born on June 19, 1861, in the town of Calamba in the province of Laguna. His parents are Francisco Mercado and Teodora Alonzo. They were considered rich and one of the largest families in those times as he had nine sisters and one brother. He was known in his family as “Pepe” when he was young.  At a very young age, he could read and write at the age of 5 and learned the alphabet at the age of 3.</P> 

            <P>In 1870, at the age of 9, he started school with his teacher Justiniano Aquino Cruz. He enrolled at Ateneo de Municipal de Manila located at the Intramuros in Manila with a post-graduate course there in land surveying and assessment. He was a very smart boy as he excelled in every subject he took. Unsurprisingly, he was recognized as the highest honours possible.</P>
            
            <P>In 1878, Rizal decided to specialize in ophthalmology at the University of Santo Tomas when his mother was going to be blind. Unfortunately, he left the early and didn’t stay for very long because according to him, the instructors were discriminating of Filipino students. But the journey didn’t stop there, he went exploring to Spain to continue his studies and studied at the Universidad Central de Madrid in 1884 where he earned his degree in medicine. In 1887, Rizal studied in Germany and Paris and was able to complete another doctorate degree in Heidelberg in 1887.  </P>
            
            <b>Later Life</b>
            <P>Jose Rizal stayed in Europe for 10 years and during that time he learned 10 languages. He impressed many people because of his intelligence and ability to master different fields of study. He became part of the Propaganda Movement build relationships with Filipinos who wanted reform. During his stay in Europe, he managed to write his first novel called “Noli Me Tangere” (touch me not) to spread awareness the dark aspects of Spanish colonial rule in the Philippines and to portray what religion and belief can really do to everyday lives. Consequently, the book was banned in the Philippines as it argues the abuse and corruption by the Catholic church and the colonial government. This made Jose Rizal return to the Philippines in 1887. “El Filibusterismo” meaning “The Reign of Greed” was written in 1891 as Jose Rizal’s second novel. Just like his first novel, he addressed the system of government in the Philippines and criticized the Spanish colonial rule in the country. These books brought Filipinos the truth and opened their eyes to reality that they were suffering unspeakable abused at the hands of the monks. </P>
            
            <P>A secret organization called “La Liga Filipina” was then formed by Jose Rizal on 3rd July 1892 in Tondo, Manila. An organization that consisted of people wanted to reform society. Because of this, Rizal got arrested and deported to Dapitan and was considered more threat by the Spanish authorities. As he was sent to Dapitan, the goal for the colonizers was to isolate him from other Filipinos so that he couldn’t influence them to see the reality. This, however, didn’t stop him from working to reform society. He built a dam and waterworks in Talisay using his engineering and architectural skills.Rizal managed to leave Dapitan granted by Governor General Blanco as volunteering as a doctor in Cuba to cure the yellow fever epidemic. During that time, the Katipunan, a successor to “La Liga Filipina” and other works from Rizal that was rejected, was launched. Then Rizal was arrested in Barcelona, in his way to Cuba as he was accused of the rebellion by the Spanish government.   </P>
            
            <P>On December 30, 1896, at Bagumbayan Field now called Luneta in Manila, Rizal was charged with rebellion, sedition and conspiracy. Therefore, he was executed and sentenced to death by firing squad. He became a national hero of the Philippines when the Spanish rule ended in 1898.  </P>

        <b>Legacy</b>
        <P>Jose Rizal is truly a hero as he stood up for his people against Spain and fought for the country in a different way. He didn’t want to begin a chaotic, massive war but instead he fought through writing because Rizal thought writing was the only non-violent way to make change. He left a legacy, and his two novels are still used today. He is a guiding light for most people as Filipinos aspire to be like him. Jose Rizal’s will never be forgotten by his people as he has contributed so much in shaping the Philippines and the perseverance that he has known throughout his life. </P>
