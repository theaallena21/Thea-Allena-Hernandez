        <b>Sacred Heart Filipino Students</b>
        <P>In Sacred Heart College, we have a significant number of Filipino girls. As a diverse school, us Filipino students express our culture and identity with a big courage and determination. We have different struggles in life and obstacles we face daily. However, we see each other as sisters and we are energized to represent our Filipino culture more. I am deeply proud to say that we are rich with beautiful traditional values are filled with joy, love and faith. Angel Zapanta, a year 11 student felt, “being a Filipino at school helps me appreciate the school more as it encourages us to be proud of our culture; you learn more about other cultures while others learn more about yours. I realized how blessed I was to be in SHC because it offers more opportunities regarding careers compared with other schools in the Philippines.” Xinia, a year 10 student that stayed in Mindanao, which would be located on the Philippines’ South Island. Her family grew up nearby her family farm in a remote rural area. She’s presently residing in Lower Hutt, New Zealand. She stated, “being a Filipino at SHC is an adventure, particularly given how diverse our school is. In the short time I've spent as a proud Filipino at my school, it's been great to see that there are other Filipinos there as well.” </P>
        
        <P>But, few Fil students still experiencing discrimination like Cayen, a leaver student as she stated, “being a Filipino in our school, especially as a year 13, you have an obligation and the honor to actually represent our country. On the good side, your able to show the beauty and capabilities of our country just by being here in NZ and in SHC but you also find that there is a bigger urge to show your culture because you find as if your culture isn't represented enough. But the bad side is that we can face some racial discrimination and prejudice from those that aren't too fond of us immigrants...” </P>
        
        <P>The lessons that the Filipino girls have taught and given me, the memories we shared with each other and the way they influenced me in many ways makes me feel more welcome to be part of our school. Us, 65, as sisters, we should look closely and understand each others differences. Therefore, we can be a more united school and not divided.</P>

        <P>Being a Filipino has influenced me in so many ways, encouraged me to show who I really am and embrace my culture with my whole heart and soul. Reminiscing on how we fought for our independence and celebrating the freedom we have as a nation really shows how the country began. Our wonderful culture, colourful heritage and hospitality are some few things that I am proud of. As a cultural being, I as a Filipino, carry my ancestors beliefs and traditions, speak the language of my parents as this actions will reflect off the next generations that would cause a continuous behavior in the society. I carry my ancestors inside me as part of who I am and as part of my culture. </P>
