        <b>Banaue Rice Terraces, Ifugao</b>
        <P>The Banaue Rice Terraces is considered as the 8th Wondered of the World by many Filipinos. A mountainous topography of towering peaks, upland and intermittent patches of valleys. The chirping of the birds brings peace and the warm hospitality of local people. It’s a home to thriving ancient culture. The rice terraces were carved out of the mountainsides by the Ifugao tribespeople in North Luzon, 2000 years ago.  According to National Geographic, the structures' original builders used stone and mud walls to carefully carve and construct terraces that could hold flooded pond fields for the cultivation of rice. They also established a system to water these plots by harvesting water from mountaintop forests. </P>
        
        <b>Chocolate Hills in Bohol</b>
        <P>The country’s varied landscape offers beautiful natural sights just like Chocolate Hills in Bohol. It is made up of 75 minor surrounding islands and it is in the Central Visayas region. The Chocolate Hills are usually covered in green grass. But during the dry season, the grass dries up and turns chocolatey brown in color. Based on google, there are at least 1,260 hills but there may be as many as 1,776 hills over an area of more than 50 square kilometers. Chocolate Hills, a conical and dome-shaped that most people compared to Hershey’s Kisses. It is one of the most visited destinations in the Central Visayas region of the Philippines.  </P>
        
        <b>Boracay</b>

        <div class="box main2"> 
        <b>Language</b>
        <P> A country that has more than 170 dialects spoken, the Philippines. Its 8 major dialects that are spoken by majority of the Filipinos are Tagalog, Cebuano, Ilocano, Hiligaynon, Bicolano, Waray, Kapampangan and Pangasinan. Today, Tagalog is spoken as a first language by around 23 million people as many local communities still speak their own language. Therefore, Tagalog is spoken as a second language by over 66 million people. Crazy, right? </P>
        
        <P>Learning and trying a whole different language can be terrifying but fun. Just like some other languages, the Philippine language itself holds an accrescent set of words and phrases. I will be teaching some words and phrases you need to know to be polite in Tagalog.   </P>
            
        <P>Every conversation starts with a greeting. In the language of Tagalog, hello and hi don’t have direct translations but if you want to do it the genuine way, use the phrase ‘Kumusta ka?’. Saying ‘Kumusta ka?’ is most direct translation for “How are you?” This is the informal way, and it is used when you are speaking with only one person. Filipinos will acknowledge your greeting with a greeting of their own.  </P>
            
        <P>Before saying kamusta, you can also greet people with the following phrases at different times of the day. A beautiful morning is a good morning. In Tagalog, you say ‘magandang umaga’ (ma‧gan‧dang u‧ma‧ga) meaning ‘good morning.’ The word ‘maganda’ means ‘beautiful’, while ‘umaga’ means ‘morning’. In the afternoon, you change ‘umaga’ to ‘hapon’. You say ‘magandang hapon’ (ma‧gan‧dang ha‧pon). During the evening, you say ‘magandang gabi’ (ma‧gan‧dang ga‧bi) meaning ‘good night’ or ‘good evening’.   </P> 
        
        <b>Showing Respect</b>
        <p>In the Philippines, respect is very important value and part of the culture. When you greet a person older than you but within the same generation, you are supposed to refer to the person as ‘ate’ (pronounced as ah-teh) for female and ‘kuya’ for males.  </p>
        
        <P>When you’re talking to our elders, someone in authority or someone in a higher level, saying ‘opo’ and ‘po’ is important in showing respect to the person you’re talking to. It is a symbol of courtesy. Saying ‘po’ doesn’t translate to ‘yes’, but it is still showing consideration. While,  ‘opo’ in english means “yes”, but in FIlipino culture, it’s an expression for giving respect to others. This is often how the young generation respond to their parents, how employees speak to their bosses and how students answer their teachers.  </P>
        
        <P>Paying respect to older people is a tradition passed from generation to generation, in the Philippines. The Filipino traditional gesture or “honouring gesture” is known as “mano” or “pagmamano”. By bowing or pressing one’s forehead on their offered hand represents respect for an elder and a way of requesting a blessing from the elder. Respecting elderly is an importance value in Filipino culture. Therefore, it is sometime considered ill-mannered or rude if one doesn’t perform the custom of pagmamano. </P>
